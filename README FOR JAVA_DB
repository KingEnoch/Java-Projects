I am designing, implementing, testing and documenting a visual application that communicates with a data persistence source. I will develop a comprehensive set of test data for the completed application. I will use the developed test data to ensure that the completed application is robust, correct, reliable. In my program I will include:
A tabbed interface that will allow a user to create, read, update and delete records from an external source.  
The interface will include a login and an about section
My optional advance features will provide a help section and a data statistics section

SQL FILE FOR GUI Application here

create table "TREATS"
(
  "ID" VARCHAR (50) not null primary key, 
  "MAKE" VARCHAR(50),
  "FLAVOUR" VARCHAR(50),
  "PURCHASED" VARCHAR(30),
  "COLOR" VARCHAR(20),
  "CONTAINS_NUTS" INTEGER default 0,
  "VEGAN_FRIENDLY" INTEGER,
  "CALORIES" INTEGER,  
  "RATING" INTEGER
);
insert into treats values ('A1', 'Ben & Jerrys', 'Birthday Cake', 'Tesco', 'Red', 0, 1, 1170, 9);

create table "CUSTOMER"
